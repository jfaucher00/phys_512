The parameters yielded a chi^2 of 15268 with a standard deviation of 175. 
This is 73 sigmas away from the number of degrees of freedom. Hence, it is
not an acceptable fit.

The second set of parameters yields a chi^2 of 3272 with a std of 81. This
value is 10 sigmas away from the number of DOF which is not ideal, but way
it shows that these parameters are way better guess than the first set.
